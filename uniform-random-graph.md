# Uniform Random Graph

### Description

Define a graph with $$n$$ nodes and $$m$$ edges as a uniform random graph, $$G(n,m)$$, if and only if the $$m$$ edges are chosen uniformly randomly from all potential edges of a complete graph of $$n$$ vertices (i.e. each one of $$\tbinom{n}{2}$$, alternatively, $$C_n^2$$ edges are chosen with the same probability).

1. What is the distribution of the degree of a vertex in $$G(n,m)$$? the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
2. What is the expected number of triangles in $$G(n,m)$$? Define a triangle as a fully-connected subgraph of $$3$$ vertices.
