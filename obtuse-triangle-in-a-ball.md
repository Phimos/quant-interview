# Obtuse Triangle in a Ball

### Description

Suppose we randomly pick 2 points A, B _**within**_ a ball centered at point O. What is the probability that the triangle formed by ABO is an obtuse one?

### Solution

This question is very similar to:

{% content-ref url="readme-1.md" %}
[readme-1.md](readme-1.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The final probalitity is $$\frac12 + \frac18=\frac58$$.
